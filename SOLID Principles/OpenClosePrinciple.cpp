// "Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification."

// This means:
// ✅ Open for Extension → We should be able to add new functionality without changing the existing code.
// ❌ Closed for Modification → We should avoid modifying existing code to prevent breaking existing functionality.
